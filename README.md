# Text Summarizer

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook contains a Python script for text summarization. Text summarization is the process of reducing a long text document into a shorter, coherent summary while preserving the most important information. This script uses the spaCy library for natural language processing to perform extractive text summarization.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install the required libraries by running:

pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm


### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vikram-307/Text-Summarizer.git
```

### Open the Jupyter Notebook
Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file named Text_Summarizer.ipynb.

### Run the Notebook
Execute the cells in the notebook one by one. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to input your text and generate summaries.

### Customization
You can customize the script for your specific use case by adjusting parameters, adding additional text preprocessing, or modifying the summarization logic.

### Save and Share
Once you have generated a summary, you can save it and share it as needed.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- spaCy (Natural Language Processing library)

### Acknowledgments
This script is inspired by the work and ideas in the field of natural language processing and text summarization.
